## Tableau API and Use Cases
I have tried to demonstrate Tableau API functionalities (Presented at DC-NoVA-Baltimore TUG)
This is an emulation of the functionalities of Tableau API, especially highlighting it's programmatic and granular control over your data.
This repository has a powerpoint presentaton in addition to Jupyter notebook code.

The code follows the workflow path in trying to achieve some/all functionalities defined.
